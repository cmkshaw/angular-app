	<h2>TIFF Official Film Schedule</h2>

	<p class="project-intro">The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tiff.net">Toronto International Film Festival</a> hosts a variety of films and events for the public and private members every September.</p>

    <p>My task as both the User Experience Designer and Web Developer was to create a responsive schedule to hold all of the festival schedule data from TIFF. </p>
    <p>
    Working closely with a designer on our team, we spec'd out the behaviours of the schedule and after approval from TIFF, I built it using jQuery. A JSON endpoint feeds data into the schedule based on selected filters chosen by the user.
