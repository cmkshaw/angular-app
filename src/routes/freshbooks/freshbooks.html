	<h2>FreshBooks</h2>

	<p class="project-intro">As FreshBooks' first front-end developer, I developed &amp; maintained the brochure website as well as the web application.</p>

	<p>As a member within a development agile scrum team, I produced user experience A/B tests, developed a styleguide, and worked on a variety of marketing initiatives while mentoring juinor developers. A lot of time and consideration was spent modernizing the website codebase, and componentizing modules to promote rapid development.</p>
