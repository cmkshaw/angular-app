	<p class="project-intro">The Toronto International Film Festival required a responsive and accessible website.</p>
	<p>
		RequireJS was used to handle JavaScript dependencies, while Bootstrap was used to provide a base for a clean front-end CSS &amp; JavaScript framework. Many of the pages were created as multi-purpose templates that could be refactored to include various types of widgets and content. The custom CMS required styling and UX considerations for ease of use.
	</p>
	<p>
		Accessibility documents, namely WCAG and ARIA guidelines were extensively researched in order to maintain a standard of accessibility across the website.
