	<h2>Colin Smith Woodworking</h2>
	<p class="project-intro">I built a WordPress theme for Colin's <a href="http://colinsmithwoodworking.com/">new website</a> to help him promote his freelance carpentry business in Toronto.
</p>
<p>
	With SEO recommendations in hand, a <a href="http://www.laurashaw.ca/">UX designer</a> and I collaborated on the overall architecture for Colin's new wesite. Using <a href="https://www.roots.io">Roots.io</a> as a base theme for WordPress, custom post types were leveraged with the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to create an extensible CMS for his products.

	Careful attention was paid to photograph size &amp; image optimization, as performance is always of concern when showcasing a portfolio with large, crisp photographs in web and mobile environments.
