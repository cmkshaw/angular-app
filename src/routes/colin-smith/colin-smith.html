	<h2>Colin Smith Woodworking</h2>
	<h3>Freelance</h3>

    <p class="project-intro">I built a WordPress theme for Colin's new website in order to support his freelance carpentry business in Toronto.
    </p>
    <p>
		With formal UX recommendations, the UX designer and I collaborated on the overall architecture for Colin's new wesite. Using <a href="https://www.roots.io">Roots.io</a> as a base theme, custom post types were leveraged with Advanced Custom Fields to create an extensible CMS for future products.
