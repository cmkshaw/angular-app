    <h2>SimpleTherapy</h2>
    <p class="project-intro"> <a target="_blank" href="http://simpletherapy.com/">SimpleTherapy</a> offers video-based, head-to-toe exercise therapy programs that target joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments.</p>
    
    <p>My challenge as both the UX designer and developer was to create an easy-to-use, simple interface to be used across multiple devices. From designing registration workflows to the account settings pages, I produced a series of wireframes to set up the main architecture for both myself and the back-end developer.

    <p>As a team of two, we used the Laravel PHP framework, coupled with Bootstrap and the HTML video API to produce the webapp.</p>

    <p>The experience can be tailored by choosing the instructor, as well as setting personal goals to work towards. There were elements of gamification for tracking progress, such as gaining badges and points for completing exercise programs. The <a href="https://www.highcarts.com">Highcharts</a> library was used to create a variety of data visualizations.
